# AgriTech Android Application
Solution
Agritech is like a smart farming helper for farmers. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to give useful advice and information at every stage of farming — from planting seeds to harvesting crops.
Here’s how Agritech helps farmers:
Crop Planning:It helps farmers choose the right crop based on their soil type, weather conditions, and region. This helps in getting better results from the very beginning.
Smart Recommendations:Agritech gives tips on the best time to plant, water, add fertilizer, or protect crops from pests and diseases. These tips are based on real-time data and expert knowledge.
Weather Alerts:It sends alerts about weather changes like rain, storms, or droughts so that farmers can protect their crops in time.
Soil and Crop Health Monitoring:With the help of AI and sensors, Agritech checks how healthy the soil and crops are and gives suggestions to improve them.
Better Yield, Less Effort:By following Agritech guidance, farmers can grow more crops using fewer resources like water, fertilizer, and labor. This saves time, money, and effort.
Easy to Use:Agritech is built in a way that even farmers who are not very tech-savvy can use it easily through a mobile app in their local language.

Technologies Used 
Kotlin: The primary programming language used for developing the Agritech Android application.

Android SDK: The Android Software Development Kit provides a set of tools and libraries to develop Android applications.

Retrofit: Used for efficient networking and API communication with the backend server.

Google Maps API: Integrated for location-based features and mapping functionality.

Weather API: Weather API to retrieve weather data, such as temperature and humidity

Development Process
Language: app developed using the Kotlin. Kotlin is a modern, concise, and expressive language that is fully compatible with Java, making it a popular choice for Android development.
IDE: Android Studio is the preferred IDE for developing Android applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools, including code editors, debuggers, emulators, and more.
Network Communication: Retrofit, a widely-used networking library, simplifies the process of making API calls, handling responses, and processing data in a type-safe manner.
Weather Data: The Agriwise app integrates with a Weather API to provide accurate weather information for auto-filling and precise recommendations based on the user's location.
Camera Integration: The app integrates the device's camera functionality to allow users to capture and upload photos. This feature is particularly useful for disease detection, as users can take pictures of affected plants and send them to the backend for analysis.
Machine Learning Model: The backend of the Agriwise app includes a machine learning model for disease detection. The app sends the uploaded photos to the backend, where the model analyzes the images and provides insights on the presence of any diseases or abnormalities in the plants.
User Interface: The app incorporates intuitive and user-friendly interfaces using Android's built-in UI components and layouts. It focuses on providing a seamless experience for farmers to access features such as soil analysis, crop recommendations, and community engagement.
